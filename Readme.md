Problem Setting: Two network clients listening for requests waiting to share files

You may need to install certain dependencies such as openssl

gcc client.c -o client

gcc server.c -o server

./client portnumber in one tab

./server portnumber in another tab

This will bind clients-server on that port.Now they will act as 2 peers.Now we can exchange tasks such as:


1. An "IndexGet" request which can request different styles of the same index of
the shared folder on the other client as listed below. The history of requests
made by either clients should be maintained at each of the clients respectively.
a. A "ShortList" request indicating that the requesting client wants to know only
the names files chosen from the time-stamps specified by the requesting client,
i.e., the client only wishes to learn about a few files.
E.g., Sample request: IndexGet<space>ShortList<space>starting-time-
stamp<space>ending-time-stamp<CRLF/EOL>
The response should include the "names", "sizes", "last modified" time-stamp and
"type" of files (if available)
b. A "LongList" request indicating that the requesting client wants to know the
entire listing of the directory of the shared folder including the "names",
"sizes", "last modified timestamp" and "type"(if available)
E.g., is similar to above with necessary changes.
c. A "RegEx" request indicating that the requesting client wants to know the list
of files that contain the regular expression pattern in their file names. The
response should include all the file names which "contain" the regular expression
pattern in their names, the sizes of the files and "type" (if available).
E.g., IndexGet<space>RegEx<space>"*mp3"<CRLF/EOL>
2. A "FileHash" request indicates that the client to enable the client to check if
any file's content has changed. Two types of "FileHash" should be supported:
a. A "Verify" request which gives the name of the file that the client wants the
hash for. The response should contain the MD5 hash of the file and the name of the
file and last modified time stamp.
E.g., FileHash<space>Verify<space>Name-of-file<CRLF/EOL>
b.A "Check All" request which is used to periodically check for modifications in
the file. The response should include the hashes of all the files, their names and
the last modified time stamp.E.g., FileHash<space>CheckAll<CRLF/EOL>
c. A "FileDownload" request, which includes the name of the file that the client
wants to download. The response should include the File, the file name, the file
size, the MD5 hash and the time-stamp when the file was last modified. The "file
size" parameter should be used by the requesting client to allocate memory and
receive the file in the allocated memory.
E.g., FileDownload<space>Name-of-file<CRLF/EOL>
d. A "FileUpload" request, which includes the name and size of the file that the
client wants to upload. The other client can either send a "FileUpload Deny" or
"FileUpload Allow" response. The other client should use the file size parameter
to allocate memory as done in "FileUpload" request. The client should upload the
file, its md5 hash and the time-stamp if it receives a "FileUpload Allow"
response. If it gets a "FileUpload Deny" then the client should go back to
listening for other requests.
E.g., FileUpload<space>Name-of-file<CRLF/EOL>
f. A "FileUpload" or "FileDownload" requests can be serviced through a UDP or TCP
based connection. If such a socket is not available, it should be created and both
clients should use that socket to exchange the file.
